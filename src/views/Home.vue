    <p>This is a sample app.</p>
    <p>
      Designed as a test bed for demonstrating Security and Privacy concepts.
      it's your regular, run of the mill 3 tiered app - a web front end, an API,
      and a database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept is simple. You create, read, update, and delete events or
      "shindigs" as I like to call them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, the app has no Security or Privacy applied (well, except for
      that that comes with the frameworks or services I'm using).
    </p>
    <p>
      As I work through the fundementals of Security and Privacy, I'll apply
      them to this app, and create different branches to give you that "before
      and after" feel.

      Finally, credit where credit is due. Thanks to the folks over a
      <a href="http://vuemastery.com" target="_blank">VueMastery</a>
      for the starter code. My responsibilities are no longer developing
      <b> <code>frontend code</code> </b>, and they made it quite easy to get
      this up and running.
